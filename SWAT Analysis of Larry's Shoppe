SWOT Analysis of Larry’s Sartorial Shoppe

Internal:
Strengths:
•	Larry’s business has been around for 30 years, which gives him an advantage in knowing the market.
•	Business is growing and growth is always good.
•	Larry’s shop has lots of options from “off the rack” suits to fully custom-tailored suits.
•	Larry has a loyal trustworthy staff.
•	Larry has loyal customers who have helped keep his business going all these years.
•	Larry must understand his business well if it has survived this long using purely paper-based systems.

Weaknesses
•	The business has become too big to manage with just paper-based systems.
•	Tracking inventory and costs has become inaccurate and is causing problems.
•	Progress on projects is difficult to track because of cumbersome work log system.
•	Growth has caused booking keeping and payroll to fall behind
•	Customer service is declining because it is difficult to track customer buying habits, salesmen numbers, and it is difficult to 
  give time lines for orders.

External:
Strengths:
•	Tracking technology would allow new systems to keep a more up to date visual representation of work progress and inventory.
•	A well-designed database system would give all departments quick and up to date access to the relevant data they need.
•	Custom or off the shelf applications would help workers input new orders, log when they use raw materials, or update order progress.  
•	Applications for clerical staff would aid in more accurate and up to date bookkeeping and payroll.
•	It may be advantageous to hire a Chief Information Officer (CIO) to over see the new information systems that will be implemented.

Weaknesses:
•	The suit sales business is a competitive market.  Most cities have multiple businesses that sell men’s work outfits and suits.
•	Online suit sales and liquidation sites threaten Larry’s sales.
•	It is always possible that one of Larry’s vendors could go out of business and then a certain line of suits or raw materials may no 
  longer be available.
•	Larry’s business is always susceptible to theft and having bad record keeping and inaccurate data allows for merchandise to disappear
  without any warning.
•	Negative economic conditions can threaten the custom-tailored side of Larry’s business because of the hire costs to do business.

SWOT Analysis of Larry’s Sartorial Shoppe
In today’s ever evolving business climate, it is almost a requirement that any business develop an electronic-based data system
that is as automated as possible to constantly provide up to date data for every department of that business.  Though Larry 
Fitzpatrick’s business has thrived for many years, it may not continue to succeed without the sorely needed updates to its paper-based 
data system. 

Though Larry’s staff and even Larry himself agree that things are becoming difficult, Larry’s Sartorial Shoppe has strengths worth
noting.  Larry has been in business making and selling suits for thirty years and he has an excellent understanding of the market. 
More than one employee mentioned that business is growing and though that may seem overwhelming, growth is a good thing.  Larry’s
business provides customers with options, whether they are seeking an “off the rack suit” or something a little more custom fitted, 
customers are provided many avenues of selection.  Larry mentioned in his interview that he trusts his staff and one manager spoke
highly about working for Mr. Fitzpatrick.  A trustworthy staff is very valuable.  To be in business for as long as Larry has, it shows
that he has a loyal customer base and has been able to continually provide service that brings in more customers.
  
The positive aspects of Larry’s Shoppe are outweighed by the reality that business is being hampered by several issues.  Firstly, 
business has become too busy to manage with the current staff and paper-based record system.  More than one employee for different 
departments noted that tracking inventory and costs has become to cumbersome and time consuming and this is causing loss of time and
materials.  Tracking progress on orders is near impossible because of the cumbersome paper-based work log system.  New business growth
is causing bookkeeping and payroll to fall behind.  It is difficult to provide the best customer service because of inaccurate order 
tracking, a lack of data for customer buying habits, and inadequate sales staff data.
  
New technology provides opportunities for a business to ease workloads or make processes more streamlined and accurate.  An electronic,
fully accessible database system would allow each department of Larry’s business to communicate and track whatever pertinent data they
may need.  An up to date tracking system would allow Larry’s manufacturing department to more easily make updates to database systems 
to give more accurate representations of inventory numbers and order progress.  In addition to tracking systems, applications may be 
developed for workers to more easily input when they finish certain processes, use raw materials, or complete orders.  Clerical staff 
should also be provided with applications to track and record payroll and daily bookkeeping.  It may be worth it to the company to hire 
a Chief Information Officer (CIO) to oversee the new information systems.
  
In a free market economy external threats are a reality that all businesses must learn to cope with if they hope to continue. 
Larry will always deal with a competitive market both in his town and online.  If one of Larry’s vendors goes out of business it
could threaten Larry’s sales and inventory.  Theft is a threat to any business and with bad records something could be stolen from 
Larry’s shop and no one would be aware.  Lastly, negative economic conditions can bring many businesses to a halt. 

With a well-developed electronic database system, Larry’s Sartorial Shoppe could be poised for many more years business.
